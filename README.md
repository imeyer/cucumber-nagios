cucumber-nagios
===============

cucumber-nagios allows you to write high-level behavioural tests of web 
application, and plug the results into Nagios. 

As Bradley Taylor [put it](http://bradley.is/post/82649218/testing-dash-metrics-with-cucumber): 

    “Instead of writing boring monitoring plugins from scratch, 
    you can now do behavior driven ops!

    Transform from a grumpy, misanthropic sysadmin to a hipster, 
    agile developer instantly.”


Quickstart
==========

 0. `gem install gemcutter`
 1. `gem tumble` 
 2. `gem install cucumber-nagios`
 3. `cucumber-nagios-gen project bunch-o-tests`
 4. `cd bunch-o-tests`
 5. `gem bundle`
 6. `bin/cucumber-nagios-gen feature ebay.com.au bidding`
 7. `bin/cucumber-nagios features/ebay.com.au/bidding.feature`


Setting up a project
====================

To set up a standalone `cucumber-nagios` project, run:

    cucumber-nagios-gen project <project-name>

This will spit out a bunch of files in the directory specified as `<project-name>`. 

Check the `README` within this directory for specific instructions for managing
the project. 


Bundling dependencies
=====================

Bundling cucumber-nagios's dependencies allows you to drop your cucumber-nagios 
project to any machine and have it run. This can be useful if you want to 
develop your tests on one machine, and deploy them to another (like a production
Nagios server). 

You'll need to bundle your dependencies to use cucumber-nagios. 

First you need to make sure the following dependencies are installed: 

  - RubyGems
	- bundler gem (automatically pulled in by the cucumber-nagios gem)

To bundle your dependencies, within your project directory run:

    $ gem bundle 


Deploying to production
=======================

Once you've copied your project around, just run the bundler again: 

    $ gem bundle

You'll need to have RubyGems and the bundler gem installed on the system 
you're deploying too. I know, this is not optimal, but hopefully the bundler
gem will handle this better in the future. 


Writing features
================

Once you've set up a project, you can use the `bin/cucumber-nagios-gen` command
to generate new features. It takes two arguments: the site you're testing, and 
feature you're testing: 

    bin/cucumber-nagios-gen feature gnome.org navigation

This will spit out two files: 

    features/gnome.org/navigation.feature
    features/gnome.org/steps/navigation_steps.rb


As for writing features, you'll want to have a read of the 
[Cucumber documentation](http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber), however
your tests will look something like this:

    Feature: google.com.au
      To broaden their knowledge
      A user should be able
      To search for things
    
      Scenario: Searching for things
        Given I visit "http://www.google.com"
        When I fill in "q" with "wikipedia"
        And I press "Google Search"
        Then I should see "www.wikipedia.org"

There's a collection of steps that will cover most of the things you'll be 
testing for in `features/steps/webrat_steps.rb`. 

You can write custom steps for testing specific output and behaviour, e.g.
in `features/smh.com.au/smh.feature`: 

    Feature: smh.com.au
      It should be up
      And provide links to content
    
      Scenario: Visiting home page
        When I go to http://smh.com.au/
        Then I should see site navigation
        And there should be a section named "Opinion"

There aren't steps for "Then I should see site navigation", so you have to 
write one yourself. :-) In `features/smh.com.au/steps/smh_steps.rb`: 

    Then /^I should see site navigation$/ do                                                                    
      doc = Nokogiri::HTML(response.body.to_s)                                                                  
      doc.css("ul#nav li a").size.should > 5                                                                    
    end

You can use Nokogiri for testing responses with XPath matchers and CSS 
selectors. 

I suggest you use `bin/cucumber` directly so you can get better feedback when 
writing your tests:

    bin/cucumber --require features/ features/smh/smh.feature

This will output using the default 'pretty' formatter. 

Running
=======

Invoke the Cucumber feature with the `cucumber-nagios` script: 

    bin/cucumber-nagios features/smh.com.au/smh.feature

`cucumber-nagios` can be run from anywhere: 

    /path/to/bin/cucumber-nagios /path/to/features/smh/smh.feature

It should return a standard Nagios-formatted response string: 

    Critical: 0, Warning: 0, 2 okay | passed=2, failed=0, total=2

Steps that fail will show up in the "Critical" total, and steps that pass 
show up in the "okay" total. 

The value printed at the end is in Nagios's Performance Data format, so it
can be graphed and the like.

Benchmarking
============

You can benchmark your features if you need to test response times for a set of
site interactions: 

    Feature: slashdot.com
      To keep the geek masses satisfied
      Slashdot must be responsive
    
      Scenario: Visiting a responsive front page
        Given I am benchmarking
        When I go to http://slashdot.org/
        Then the elapsed time should be less than 5 seconds

The elapsed time step can be reused multiple times in the same scenario if you
need fine grained testing: 

    Feature: slashdot.com
      To keep the geek masses satisfied
      Slashdot must be responsive
    
      Scenario: Visiting news articles
        Given I am benchmarking
        When I go to http://slashdot.org/
        Then the elapsed time should be less than 5 seconds
        When I follow "Login"
        Then the elapsed time should be less than 4 seconds
        When I follow "Contact"
        Then the elapsed time should be less than 7 seconds



Quirks
======

Failure *is* an option (exceptions are good)
--------------------------------------------

Exceptions raised within your tests will appear in the failed totals, so you 
don't need to worry about trying to catch them in your own custom steps. 

i.e. if you try fetching a page on a server that is down, or the page returns 
a 404, the exception raised by Mechanize just gets treated by Cucumber as a 
test failure. 


Version control
===============

It's highly recommend that you store your cucumber-nagios projects in a version
control system!

To get up and running with git: 

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'created cucumber-nagios project'

To get up and running with bzr:

    $ bzr init
    $ bzr add
    $ bzr commit -m 'created cucumber-nagios project'

`.bzrignore` and `.gitignores` are created when you generate a project.

Testing
-------

The gem is thoroughly tested (with Cucumber, no less). The gem's Cucumber
features live in $gemroot/features/, and can be run with: 

    $ cucumber --require features/ features/installing.feature
    $ cucumber --require features/ features/creating.feature
    $ cucumber --require features/ features/using.feature
